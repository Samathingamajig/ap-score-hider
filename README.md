# AP Score Hider

Normally when you go to check your AP Exam scores, you see all the scores at once. Since I'm often bored, I decided to solve this problem. With this script, you can make it so all your scores are hidden until you click "Your score" on each test. Since I was still bored after implementing this, I added confetti that explodes if you get a passing score (3+), with more the higher your score is.

## ⚡️ Is this a virus?

Nope! Anyone that understands basic English can understand the script.

The code:

-   🔓 is 100% open source (because it needs to be so you can install it)
-   🔍 has very detailed comments on almost each line
-   🔒 only runs on the specific AP Scores page
-   📶 makes no network requests
-   👨‍💻️ is written in JavaScript
-   💻 can't do anything to your computer

## 📜 Installation

-   Install Tampermonkey from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/))
-   After this, you have two options (only do one of these):
    -   **GreasyFork** _(recommended)_: Go to the [GreasyFork page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/429680-ap-score-hider) and click the green "Install this script" button. This will take you to a page on Tampermonkey where you need to click "Install" to install the script.
    -   **GitHub/Manual install** _(not recommended)_: Go to the [raw script page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Samathingamajig/ap-score-hider/main/ap-score-hider.user.js). Tampermonkey will automatically detect this file as a userscript (since the file is named `*.user.js`), so click the "Install" button to install it. If it doesn't, copy the entire contents of the script into the Tampermonkey script editor (**make sure you save**).
    -   If none of these work, look up how to install a Tampermonkey userscript.

## 🚫 Uninstallation

If you don't want to use this script anymore, you can uninstall it anytime.

-   Navigate to the Tampermonkey dashboard (click the extension icon in the top right, then click "Dashboard" at the bottom of the popup)
-   Click the trashcan on the right side of the page
